<h1> Projects Porfolio- Assignment 1</h1>
<h3> This website is built for Assignment-1(Advanced Server Side Scripting COMP 2106) at Georgian College</h3>
<p>This website is about my projects that I have done so far. I would use this website as a portfolio to show the employers.</p>
<p> This website consist of Five pages: <br>1. Home<br>2. About<br>3. Services<br>3. Portfolio<br>2. Contact
<p>I am using CSS template from <a href="http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page220/optics">Optics free Templates</a> to make my portfolio wbsite attractive. I have used Stylesheets and Javascript files from the template. Followed some pattern of Theme to make website look good.I have used my own pictures and pictures from Unsplash too.</p>
<p>I have used PHP for contact page. I tried my best to make a working contact page with the help of Node.JS, but I was unable to do so. I would make it possibly in near future.</p>
<p> I have a Domain name (www.rajvinderyogi.com), but that does not support nodeJS.</p>
